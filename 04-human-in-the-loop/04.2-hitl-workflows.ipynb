    "# Request and Response in Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executors** are where computation happens. When an executor emits a message, it flows along the edges to downstream executors which activate when their dependent data becomes available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the internal flow, executors can also pause and send requests outside the workflow to wait for responses which is useful for any operations that depend on external systems or humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how tool approvals work to control agent actions, let's explore how Agent Framework handles HITL interactions at the workflow level. In this section, we'll examine how executors can pause execution to request human input or approval, wait for responses, and then continue processing based on that feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this section, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand** the request-response pattern of Agent Framework\n",
    "- **Build** a complete content generation system with human approval requirements\n",
    "- **Implement** multi-executor workflows\n",
    "- **Apply** these concepts by building your own HITL approval system\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in Request/Response message handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Executors have two primary mechanisms for request-response interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sending requests via `ctx.request_info`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `ctx.request_info(request_data=request_data, response_type=response_type)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Pause workflow execution and request external input\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Workflow emits a `RequestInfoEvent` containing your request data\n",
    "- Workflow execution pauses at this point\n",
    "- The event surfaces to the external application\n",
    "- External system processes the request and provides a response\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling responses via `@response_handler`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    @response_handler\n",
    "    async def on_human_feedback(\n",
    "        self,\n",
    "        original_request: HumanFeedbackRequest,\n",
    "        feedback: str,\n",
    "        ctx: WorkflowContext[AgentExecutorRequest, str],\n",
    "    ) -> None:\n",
    "        # Process response and continue\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Define how to handle responses when they arrive\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically registered to handle responses matching the request/response types\n",
    "- Framework routes the response to this method when received\n",
    "- You can then continue processing or send messages to other executors\n",
    "\n",
    "Executors can send requests directly using `ctx.request_info()` and handle responses using the `@response_handler` decorator\n"

    "### Example - Content Generation with HITL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll build a content generation and approval workflow where AI-generated responses must receive human approval before being delivered to users. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → Worker (AI Generator) → Reviewer (Escalator) → Human Moderator\n",
    "                ↑                           ↓\n",

    "                              ↓\n",
    "                        Final Output → User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of two executors operating in a feedback loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Worker** generates AI responses and sends them for review\n",
    "2. **Reviewer** escalates to a human for approval/rejection\n",
    "3. **Human** makes the decision (simulated in this demo)\n",
    "4. **Reviewer** forwards the decision back to Worker\n",
    "5. **Worker** either emits approved content or regenerates based on feedback\n",
