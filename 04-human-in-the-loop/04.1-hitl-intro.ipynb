    "## Introduction to Human In The Loop in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows in the Microsoft Agent Framework allow developers to design, monitor, and control how multiple AI agents and logic components interact to complete complex tasks. They bring structure, flexibility, and transparency to agent-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to bring in control and manage agent workflows is to add human approvals. When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a **human-in-the-loop** pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "An agent run that requires user input will complete with a response that indicates what input is required from the user instead of completing with a final answer. The caller of the agent is then responsible for getting the required input from the user and passing it back to the agent as part of a new agent run.\n"

    "#### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `@ai_function(approval_mode=\"always_require\")`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `@ai_function` decorator to specify metadata. To create a function that requires approval, you can use the `approval_mode` parameter so the agent can pause and ask for user approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First agent Run and User Input Request:\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent run `result` is an `AgentRunResponse` object which has a `user_input_requests` attribute of type `list[UserInputRequestContents]`. The run returns one `UserInputRequestContent` type message per tool call, and often there are several approval requests per agent run so it's important to inspect all pending approvals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if result.user_input_requests:\n",
    "        print(\"Approval required:\")\n",
    "        for user_input_needed in result.user_input_requests:\n",
    "            print(f\"Function: {user_input_needed.function_call.name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you now have a function that requires approval, the agent can respond with a request for approval instead of executing the function directly and returning the result.You should check the agent run response for any user input requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the function call including name and arguments can be found in the `function_call` property on the user input request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    user_input_needed.function_call.name\n",
    "    user_input_needed.function_call.arguments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create the Approval Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the user has provided their input, you can create a response using the `.create_response()` method on the user input request. Pass True to approve the function call, or False to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response should then be passed to the agent in a new ChatMessage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    approval_message = ChatMessage(\n",
    "    role=Role.USER, \n",
    "        contents=[user_input_needed.create_response(user_approval)]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "`.create_response(user_approval)` links the approval response back to the original function call request (`user_input_needed`) and embeds the approval decision (boolean) inside a `FunctionApprovalResponseContent` type message the framework understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resuming Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting user approval decisions for pending function calls, you need to resume the agent's execution by reconstructing the conversation history. To resume execution, you must provide the original query, the agent's function call requests and the user's approval responses as ChatMessage objects:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    final_result = await agent1.run([\n",
    "    \"What is the detailed weather like in Amsterdam?\",\n",
    "    ChatMessage(role=Role.ASSISTANT, contents=[user_input_needed]),\n",
    "    approval_message\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "By providing both messages, you're reconstructing the conversation flow: the agent proposed an action (ASSISTANT), and the user responded to that proposal (USER).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note*: In this example, if the user rejects a function call (`user_approval = False`), the agent doesn't simply fail. Instead, it attempts to fulfill the user's intent using alternative available tool - `get_weather`. In this example, if `get_weather_detail` is rejected, the agent may fall back to calling `get_weather` (which doesn't require approval) to still provide some weather information."

    "### Request and Response\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In AF, agent execution is fundamentally about the **data flow** - a workflow will keep running as long as there is data being passed. Agents don't \"call\" each other or pass control in a traditional procedural sense. Instead, they communicate through typed messages flowing between executors through edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executors** are where computation happens. When an executor emits a message, it flows along the edges to downstream executors which activate when their dependent data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Approval Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the message can also be used to let the application approve or disapprove some actions the agent wants to take.\n",
    "**User Approval Content** type enables human-in-the-loop approvals within the standard message flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approval mechanism intercepts the normal tool invocation flow, pausing execution until human approval is granted or denied:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/reqresp.png\" alt=\"User Approval Content Type\" style=\"width:70%; height:40%; margin:20px auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When a ChatAgent needs to invoke a Tool that requires approval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Inference**: The ChatAgent uses the Model to make an inference and determines it needs to invoke the Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approval Request**: Before executing, the Tool sends a request back to the ChatAgent, which surfaces to the Application as `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` (a special ChatMessage content type).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Response**: The Application presents this approval request to the user, who responds (Yes/No). This response is sent back to the ChatAgent as `FunctionApprovalResponseContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**: Once the ChatAgent receives approval, the Tool executes and returns its result to the ChatAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Inference**: The Model makes another inference using the Tool's result to generate a natural language response as `TextContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complete Response**: The Application receives both the `FunctionResultContent` (the raw tool output) and the `TextContent` (the Model's interpretation of that result).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Approval Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "User approvals are necessary in many cases, especially when tool execution involves external resources or has side effects. Common scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Irreversible operations**: Data deletion, financial transactions, resource provisioning\n",
    "- **External system access**: Database modifications, API calls, file system operations\n",
    "- **Security-sensitive actions**: Credential access, permission changes, privileged operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When a tool requires approval, the agent pauses execution and transfers control to the application. The agent preserves its state (conversation history, pending actions, context) and waits for the application's decision before proceeding. This mechanism ensures critical operations require explicit human authorization while maintaining the agent's execution context for immediate resumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in Chapter 1, **Agent Middleware** provides a general-purpose mechanism for intercepting agent interactions at three levels: agent (intercepts entire agent execution), function (intercepts individual tool invocations), and chat (intercepts LLM calls). You can think of the process of user approval during tool invocation as *tool middleware*. "
