    "# Introduction to Human In The Loop in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows in the Microsoft Agent Framework allow developers to design, monitor, and control how multiple AI agents and logic components interact to complete complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to bring in control and manage agent workflows is to add human approvals. When agents require any user input, for example to approve a function call, this is referred to as a **human-in-the-loop** pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how user approvals work in Agent Framework\n",
    "- Create AI functions that require human approval using `approval_mode`\n",
    "- Work with different ChatMessage content types (Text, FunctionCall, FunctionResult, Approval)\n",
    "- Build complete workflows with approval gates\n",
    "- Access and inspect conversation threads for observaibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let's first understand how Agent Framework handles external system interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Approval Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In AF, agent execution is fundamentally about the **data flow** - a workflow will keep running as long as there is data being passed. Agents don't \"call\" each other or pass control in a traditional procedural sense. Instead, they communicate through typed messages flowing between executors through edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the message can also be used to let the application approve or disapprove some actions the agent wants to take.\n",
    "**User Approval Content** type enables HITL approvals within the standard message flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approval mechanism intercepts the normal tool invocation flow, pausing execution until human approval is granted or denied:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/reqresp.png\" alt=\"User Approval Content Type\" style=\"width:70%; height:40%; margin:20px auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When a ChatAgent needs to invoke a Tool that requires approval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Inference**: The ChatAgent uses the Model to make an inference and determines it needs to invoke the Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Approval Request**: Before executing, the Tool sends a request back to the ChatAgent, which surfaces to the Application as `FunctionApprovalRequestContent` (a special ChatMessage content type).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Response**: The Application presents this approval request to the user, who responds (Yes/No). This response is sent back to the ChatAgent as `FunctionApprovalResponseContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**: Once the ChatAgent receives approval, the Tool executes and returns its result to the ChatAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Inference**: The Model makes another inference using the Tool's result to generate a natural language response as `TextContent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complete Response**: The Application receives both the `FunctionResultContent` (the raw tool output) and the `TextContent` (the Model's interpretation of that result).\n",
    "\n"
