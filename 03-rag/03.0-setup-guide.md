## Azure AI Search: Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the Azure AI Search service needed for the RAG labs. The indexing, chunking, and embedding generation are done programmatically in `03.1-rag-fundamentals.ipynb`.

### What You'll Set Up

1. **Azure AI Search service** - For indexing and searching your documents
2. **Embedding model deployment** - For generating vector embeddings

---

#### Introduction to Azure AI Search

**Azure AI Search** is a fully managed search-as-a-service that lets you add sophisticated search capabilities to your apps without managing infrastructure.

**Core capabilities:**
- Full-text search, filtering, faceting, and autocomplete
- **Vector search** - Understanding meaning and context
- **Vector search** - Similarity matching using embeddings  
- **Semantic search** - Combining keyword and vector approaches

---

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure you have:

- **Completed the Microsoft Foundry project creation** by following the steps in the README
- **Identified your resource group in Azure Portal**: You can find the resource group name under **"Project details"** on your project's **"Overview"** page in Foundry.

---

#### Step 1: Create an Azure AI Search service

1. Navigate to your project's resource group in the Azure portal and create a new Azure AI Search service resource:
   - Create -> Search for "Azure AI Search"
   - It is recommended to create the search service in the same region as your AI project
   - Select 'Standard' tier, which is required for these labs

2. In Foundry Portal, deploy an embedding model the same way we initially set up the gpt-4o chat model deployment:
   - Select `text-embedding-3-large` and deploy it. This will be used later to create the vector embeddings for our documents.

---

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://<search-service-name>.search.windows.net
INDEX_NAME=healthplan-index
SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-search-api-key>
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=text-embedding-3-large
```

You can find the search API key in the Azure Portal under your Search Service -> Settings -> Keys.

### Next Steps

The setup is done! Now proceed to:

1. **`03.1-rag-fundamentals.ipynb`** - Create your search index programmatically and learn RAG mechanics
2. **`03.2-context-providers.ipynb`** - Use Context Providers for elegant RAG abstraction
