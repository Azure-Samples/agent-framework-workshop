    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Provider Lifecycle** - `invoking()` runs before the LLM, `invoked()` runs after\n",
    "2. **AzureAISearchContextProvider** - Built-in RAG with automatic search and context injection\n",
    "3. **AggregateContextProvider** - Combine multiple knowledge sources elegantly\n",
    "4. **Custom Providers** - Build specialized context injection for your use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context Providers abstract away RAG complexity while remaining flexible\n",
    "- Use `context_provider` (singular) parameter - wrap multiple providers in `AggregateContextProvider`\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversations work automatically with `AgentThread`\n",
    "- Custom providers enable personalization, memory, and specialized retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Topics (Not Covered)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Framework supports additional patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agentic mode** - Multi-hop reasoning with Azure AI Search Knowledge Bases\n",
    "- **TextSearchProvider** - Function-based RAG with custom search delegates\n",
    "- **Mem0 Provider** - Long-term memory across conversation sessions\n",
    "- **Redis Provider** - Fast retrieval with full-text and vector search\n",
