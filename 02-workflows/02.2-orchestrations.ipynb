    "## Agent Framework Workflows Orchestrations\n",
    "Traditional single-agent systems are limited in their ability to handle complex, multi-faceted tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent orchestration addresses this limitation by allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign distinct skills, responsibilities, or perspectives to each agent.\n",
    "- Combine outputs from multiple agents to improve decision-making and accuracy.\n",
    "- Coordinate steps in a workflow so each agent’s work builds on the last.\n",
    "- Dynamically route control between agents based on context or rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestrations** are pre-built workflow patterns that allow developers to quickly create complex workflows by simply plugging in their own AI agents. Instead of manually wiring every edge, you can use these patterns to define how agents interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all patterns share the same core interface, you can easily experiment with different orchestration strategies without rewriting agent logic or learning new APIs. The SDK abstracts the complexity of agent communication, coordination, and result aggregation so you can focus on designing workflows that deliver results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Framework provides five orchestration patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential** - Agents execute one after another in a defined order, ideal for linear processing\n",
    "2. **Concurrent** - Broadcast the same task to multiple agents at once and collect results independently.\n",
    "3. **Handoff** - Control is dynamically transferred from one agent to another based on context or role.\n",
    "4. **Group chat** - Coordinate a shared conversation among multiple agents managed by a chat manager that decides who speaks next and when to stop.\n",
    "5. **Magentic** - Manager-driven approach where agents dynamically pull tasks based on the evolving context, task progress, and agent capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Agent Framework documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/orchestrations/overview) to learn more about these orchestration types and check out the [Agent Framework repo](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/orchestration) to see more advanced orchestration types in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover **Sequential**, **Concurrent**, and **Group Chat** orchestrations in detail. Handoff and Magentic are introduced in the exercise section with links to documentation and samples."

    "In this notebook, you learned about pre-built orchestration patterns in the Agent Framework:\n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Orchestration | Description |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Sequential** | Agents execute one after another in a pipeline, each building on the previous output |\n",
    "| **Concurrent** | Multiple agents work on the same task in parallel, results are aggregated |\n",
    "| **Group Chat** | Collaborative conversation with a chat manager controlling speaker selection |\n",
    "| **Handoff** | Dynamic control transfer between agents based on context |\n",
    "| **Magentic** | Manager-driven approach where agents pull tasks based on evolving context |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Pipeline** - Meal planner and budget estimator working in sequence\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Workflow** - Researcher, marketer, and legal agents processing in parallel\n",
    "3. **Group Chat** - Writer, editor, and researcher with custom speaker selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sequential orchestration\n",
    "workflow = SequentialBuilder().participants([agent1, agent2]).build()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concurrent orchestration\n",
    "workflow = ConcurrentBuilder().participants([agent1, agent2, agent3]).build()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Group chat with custom speaker selection\n",
    "def select_speaker(state: GroupChatState) -> str:\n",
    "    # Custom logic to determine next speaker\n",
    "    return next_agent_name\n",
    "\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    GroupChatBuilder()\n",
    "    .with_select_speaker_func(select_speaker, orchestrator_name=\\\"Orchestrator\\\")\n",
    "    .participants([agent1, agent2, agent3])\n",
    "    .with_termination_condition(lambda conversation: len(conversation) >= 6)\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chapter 2 Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the skills to build sophisticated multi-agent systems with:\n",
    "- Custom workflows with executors and edges (02.1)\n",
    "- Agents as workflow components (02.1)\n",
    "- Pre-built orchestration patterns (02.2)\n",
    "- Event-driven observability and streaming (02.1, 02.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Chapter 3**, you'll learn about **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to give your agents access to external knowledge!"
