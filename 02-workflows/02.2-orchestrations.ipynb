     "In this notebook, we'll cover three orchestration patterns:\n",
     "\n",
     "- **Sequential** - Agents work in a pipeline, each building on the previous output\n",
     "- **Concurrent** - Agents work in parallel on the same task, results are aggregated\n",
     "- **Group Chat** - Agents collaborate in a managed conversation with iterative refinement\n",
     "\n",
     "We'll use a common theme throughout: **launching a new product**. This will help you see how each pattern fits different stages of a real workflow."
