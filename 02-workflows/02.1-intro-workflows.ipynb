    "## Summary & Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned the fundamentals of building workflows with the Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Executor** | A processing unit that receives typed messages, performs operations, and produces outputs |\n",
    "| **WorkflowContext** | Provides methods (`send_message`, `yield_output`) for handlers to interact with the workflow |\n",
    "| **Edges** | Define connections between executors with optional conditions for routing |\n",
    "| **WorkflowBuilder** | Fluent API for constructing workflows by connecting executors |\n",
    "| **Workflow Events** | Observable events (`WorkflowOutputEvent`, `ExecutorFailedEvent`, etc.) for monitoring execution |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Executors** - Class-based and function-based executors with `@handler` decorators\n",
    "2. **Sequential Workflows** - Linear pipelines connecting multiple executors\n",
    "3. **Concurrent Workflows** - Fan-out/fan-in patterns for parallel processing\n",
    "4. **Agent Workflows** - Integrated AI agents as workflow executors\n",
    "5. **Custom Agent Executors** - Wrapped agents with streaming event handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function-based executor (stateless - can pass directly)\n",
    "@executor(id=\"validate_order\")\n",
    "async def validate_order(order: dict, ctx: WorkflowContext[dict]) -> None:\n",
    "    order[\"is_valid\"] = order.get(\"quantity\", 0) > 0\n",
    "    await ctx.send_message(order)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple workflow with stateless executors\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    WorkflowBuilder()\n",
    "    .add_edge(validate_order, process_order)\n",
    "    .set_start_executor(validate_order)\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# For agents/stateful executors - use factory functions for state isolation\n",
    "def create_writer_agent():\n",
    "    return chat_client.as_agent(instructions=\"...\", name=\"writer\")\n",
    "\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    WorkflowBuilder()\n",
    "    .register_agent(factory_func=create_writer_agent, name=\"writer\")\n",
    "    .set_start_executor(\"writer\")\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook (`02.2-orchestrations.ipynb`), you'll learn about **pre-built orchestration patterns** including Sequential, Concurrent, and Group Chat orchestrations that simplify multi-agent coordination."
