    "**AI Agents** are dynamic - the LLM decides what steps to take at runtime based on context and available tools. Use when you need flexibility, reasoning, and open-ended problem solving.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned the fundamentals of building workflows with the Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Executor** | A processing unit that receives typed messages, performs operations, and produces outputs |\n",
    "| **WorkflowContext** | Provides methods (`send_message`, `yield_output`) for handlers to interact with the workflow |\n",
    "| **Edges** | Define connections between executors with optional conditions for routing |\n",
    "| **WorkflowBuilder** | Fluent API for constructing workflows by connecting executors |\n",
    "| **Workflow Events** | Observable events (`WorkflowOutputEvent`, `ExecutorFailedEvent`, etc.) for monitoring execution |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Executors** - Class-based and function-based executors with `@handler` decorators\n",
    "2. **Sequential Workflows** - Linear pipelines connecting multiple executors\n",
    "3. **Concurrent Workflows** - Fan-out/fan-in patterns for parallel processing\n",
    "4. **Agent Workflows** - Integrated AI agents as workflow executors\n",
    "5. **Custom Agent Executors** - Wrapped agents with streaming event handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function-based executor (stateless - can pass directly)\n",
    "@executor(id=\"my_executor\")\n",
    "async def my_step(data: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:\n",
    "    await ctx.send_message(data.upper())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple workflow with stateless executors\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    WorkflowBuilder()\n",
    "    .add_edge(executor_a, executor_b)\n",
    "    .set_start_executor(executor_a)\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# For agents/stateful executors - use factory functions for state isolation\n",
    "def create_agent():\n",
    "    return chat_client.as_agent(instructions=\"...\", name=\"agent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    WorkflowBuilder()\n",
    "    .register_agent(factory_func=create_agent, name=\"agent\")\n",
    "    .set_start_executor(\"agent\")\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook (`02.2-orchestrations.ipynb`), you'll learn about **pre-built orchestration patterns** including Sequential, Concurrent, and Group Chat orchestrations that simplify multi-agent coordination."
